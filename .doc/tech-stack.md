# Tech Stack

The Tech Stack is a set of technologies we use to build our Ambev products, which is why we can consider it the heart of our products.

All versions of languages, frameworks, and tools have been carefully chosen based on a predefined strategy. We selected the technologies based on our daily challenges and needs.

We use the following technologies in this project:

Backend:

- __.NET 8.0__: A free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
  - Git: [https://github.com/dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
  - Git: [https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang)

Testing:

- Git: [https://github.com/xunit/xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit)

Frontend:

Databases:
